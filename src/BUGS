On all:
in BuildEngine, atomic move has been replaced by remove + rename because
rename does not work on Windows if target file exists.
Consequently, rename is not atomic anymore, and might cause a problem
if ocamlopt and ocamlc are run concurrently for the same file.

On Windows:
  '-ccopt' '' '-ccopt' ''
  gives "unknown options -ccopt"
