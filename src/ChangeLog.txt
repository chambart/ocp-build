2011-11-16: Fabrice
 - Fix: renamed boot/ocp-build.byte to boot/ocp-build.boot to avoid it being
     cleaned by -distclean
 - Fix: -program-ocp now generates a program description
 - Fix: correctly save list of files in ocp-build.root after -scan

2011-07-12: Fabrice
 - Added file 'ocp-standard-ocaml.ocp' that can be used to describe
   what is expected from the current OCaml distribution.

2011-04-08: Fabrice
 - Added option -conf, to generate a file with the commands
   to use to compile. The file can be manually modified.
   The file can be stored either in a per-user fashion (in ~/.ocp/)
   or in a per-project fashion (in ~/_obuild/).
 - Added option -distrib, to generate .ocp files for all installed
   libraries. These files can be manually edited. Most dependencies
   are automatically generated.
 - Added option -autogen, to generate a .ocp file for a given directory,
   containing infered sources in the right order. External dependencies
   are not yet computed.

2011-03-18: Fabrice
  - Rewritten parser of OCF files, more strict, with locations.
     - Options per file between parenthesis
     - begin ... end scopes limiters
     - projects names are between ""
     - new option "generated"
  - New arguments:
     -oclean: remove binary files by extension
     -odistclean: remove generated files by extension
     - anonymous arguments are used as targets
  - Replaced argument -opt by -asm, extension .opt by .asm
  - Print better error locations (if an error occurs while running a rule,
     print the location of the project).

2011-03-17: Fabrice
  - Added per project options
     dep: flags for ocamldep (also added by 'o')
  - Added "objects" type for collection of files, without generating a library
  - Added project links: a file "foo:bar.ml" means that the project will use
     the files generated from bar.ml in the foo project.
  - Added "project_SRC_DIR" and "project_DST_DIR" to env for each project
  - Added statistics on executed commands and generated files

2011-03-16: Fabrice
  - Added per project options, with lists of arguments:
     o : flags for ocamlc, ocamlopt and ocamldep
     comp : flags for compiling (ocamlc -c, ocamlopt -c)
     link : flags for linking (ocamlc and ocamlopt)
     asm : flags for ocamlopt
     byte : flags for ocamlc
     asmcomp, asmlink, bytecomp, bytelink : flags for ocamlc or ocamlopt X compiling or linking
     pp : preprocessor

2011-03-15: First commit from SVN (Fabrice)
  - Bug fixes:
    - .cmi files are always generated, even when no static dependencies are present
    - already generated projects do not create rules
